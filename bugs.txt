RE: Problem with proxy  - https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1018432&forum_id=63529
  People have problems declaring static proxies, which crashes their app. Give a better error somehow?

E-mailed problems:
------------------
- Need clarification about what "globally #defining" something means
- Fix farked up line endings in all files - shows up on Linux boxes
- Fast copying a C++ array to a Jace array
- Code that depends upon the peer being "set up" can not be called from any Java peer constructor
  (probably need to add a callback or something)
- Gili wants native methods with original argument names - we could try and look and see if they are there
(I'm pretty sure those name are only available when compiling java files with -g)


  
Features I want to add:
-----------------------
- Translate documentation from HTML to OO, then we generate PDF and html from OO.

- Support for C++ callbacks. I.E. Let people define a Peer that can be subclassed multiple times
  Potentially change the existing Peer infrastructure altogether, so that people always subclass

- Better support for arrays and primitives

- A specific toolkit for JMS

- What else?
